## What is this?
Instead of making a non-extensive list of links (don't get me wrong, I'll also provide this list), I'm aiming to write some articles and contribute to the community based on what I've experienced and worked with my teams, as well as what did not work for me, but it can for you.
It's also my goal to provide tools to help you through this journey and maybe facilitate the path for you! :)
